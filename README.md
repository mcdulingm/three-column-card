## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build the design of a 3 Column Card Component, using any solution. It needs to match the original design as much as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I firstly defined the rules in my stylesheet for example the font sizes, minimun and maximum box sizes and more. I then continued to work from mobile first approach.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used the CSS flexbox layout with this challenge. Very basic but that's all that needed for this component.

### Continued development

I would like to try and recreate this solution using CSS Grid layout. Probably update it at sometime to use BEM CSS Naming .
